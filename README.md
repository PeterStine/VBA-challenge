# VBA-challenge
> Overview
Analysis of generated stock market data using Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel

> Note: (Handwritten): For part of this data analysis, I made use of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Rather than copy-paste code from the tool, I opted for a more enriching experience. I did this through asking for vague and challenging hints as to what is wrong with my code when I get stuck, to get me to think. This allowed me to fluently understand the structures in Visual Vasic for Applications. Along the way, I fed it parts of the updated Microsoft documentation (The knowledge cutoff for these Large-Language-Models is 2021) to utilize the tool as a "Second Pair of Eyes" for filtering through documentation. In addition, I had it challenge me on different concepts, a sample of which can be found below:

# Part 1.A
> Instructions (From University of Oregon's Data Analytics Program)
Script should loop through all stocks for one year and output the following:

- Ticker symbol
- Difference between opening and closing annual price
- Percentage difference between the annual opening and closing price
- The total stock volume of the stock

# Part 1.B
> Pseudocode (Handwritten)

- FOR-LOOP: 
    - **Will only increment counter after a full inner traversal**
    - *Note:* **This would require unsorted datasets to be sorted.**
    - FOR-LOOP: 
        - **This loop will reset it's counter each time it fully    traverses a single trading symbol, such as AAB, AAF, and so on.**
        - 
        - innerCounter = innerCounter + 1
    - END INNER LOOP
- END OUTER LOOP

# Part 1.C
